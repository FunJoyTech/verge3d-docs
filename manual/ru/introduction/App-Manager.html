    <h1>App Manager</h1>

    <p>App Manager is an easy-to-use tool for creating and performing various operations with Verge3D applications.</p>

    [anchor:Running_App_Manager]

    <h2>Running App Manager</h2>

    <p>
    The App Manager is implemented as web pages shown by the locally-run web server, similar to WiFi router admin panel.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-main.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p>
    By default, the pages are served from the address <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a>, which you can navigate to, refresh or bookmark. The server can be launched in several ways (see below).
    </p>



    [anchor:From_Blender_Max_Maya]

    <h3>A. From Blender, 3ds Max or Maya</h3>

    <p>The local web server is started automatically when you launch your 3D tool with Verge3D plug-in installed. Upon clicking on the App Manager button (Blender) or menu option (Max, Maya), the App Manager page is shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-blender.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 951px">
    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-max.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 951px">

    <p>
    If the web server happens to be down for some reason (e.g. you closed the first launched instance of your 3D editor), this operator also restarts it.
    </p>



    [anchor:Using_Desktop_Application]

    <h3>B. Using Desktop Application</h3>

    <p>The local web server can be launched even without Blender, 3ds Max or Maya. Simply click on the desktop icon created by the Verge3D installer (Windows-only). The App Manager page will be immediately shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-desktop-icon.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p>
    If the web server is already running (e.g. you launched it from the 3D editor), this desktop application just opens the App Manager in the browser.
    </p>



    [anchor:In_Command_Line]

    <h3>C. In Command-Line</h3>

    <p>
    Install Python 3, e.g. from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>. Once you have Python 3 installed, launch *Command Prompt* and type:
    </p>

    <code>
    cd verge3d
    </code>

    <p>
    (or whatever path you installed Verge3D in), and then for Blender version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py BLENDER
    </code>

    <p>
    for Max version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAX
    </code>

    <p>
    or for Maya:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAYA
    </code>

    <p>
    Finally, open up the browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a> as usual. Users of maxOS or Linux can use the same commands, only with forward slashes.
    </p>



    [anchor:Exploring_Applications]

    <h2>Exploring Applications</h2>



    [anchor:List_Main_Page]

    <h3>List on the Main Page</h3>

    <p>
    Upon starting or refreshing the main page, the App Manager scans the folder *applications* in the installation directory, and displays all found folders as a list. If *External applications directory* is specified in App Manager settings, the folders from inside that directory are also appended to the bottom of the list.
    </p>

    <p>
    For each application in the list, the App Manager displays all .html, .gltf/.glb and 3D editor save files (.blend, .max, .ma/.mb) found in an application folder. These files can be viewed by clicking on their icons.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Application lines which contain too many files are expandable through the triangle icon near app name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files-expand.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Applications can be filtered using the search field on the top.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-search.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">



    [anchor:Application_Page]

    <h3>Application Page</h3>

    <p>
    By clicking on the application name, a more elaborate page is shown.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-app-link.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    On the application page, all files are listed with their names, also runnable. The files on this page are filterable via the search input.
    </p>

    <p>
    You may type a name for the new application, and select a template from which the app will be created. By default, 3 templates are offered: Standard Light/Dark and Code-Based. More templates can be added for choosing from.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-create-options.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
    You can also include optional modules in the application to enable Internet Explorer 11 support, add compatibility with the legacy WebVR API, or include the physics engine in the application.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once a new application is created, there will be shown a link which you may use to go to the application page (or you may just close it).
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-created.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">
