    <p>
    A procedure can be triggered several times and from several places of a Puzzles scenario. This may allow for re-using puzzles rather than straight-copying similar set of puzzles several times. For example, an animation can be launched whenever the user clicks the object itself or an HTML button (thus securing duplicate controls).
    </p>

    [anchor:procedure_with_return]

    <h2>Procedures with Return Value</h2>

    <p>
    A procedure may output a computed value to its caller (aka return value). To create such a procedure, from the toolbox drag out the variant of the procedure puzzle with the return slot.

    [anchor:if_return]

    <h2>Using "if return" Puzzle</h2>

    <p>
    A procedure may return a value upon some condition before all inside puzzles are interpreted. In this case the procedure stops running prematurely.
