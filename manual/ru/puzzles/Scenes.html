    <h2>Puzzles Reference</h2>


    [anchor:load_scene]

    <h3>load scene + percentage</h3>

    <p>
    When this puzzle is triggered, the current scene is unloaded
    and a new scene is loaded from a specified .gltf file. After loading
    is finished, the puzzles in the "when loaded do" slot are triggered.
    Also there can be enabled the "on progress do" slot. Puzzles placed
    in this slot are continuously triggered during the loading and can
    utilize the "percentage" puzzle. Once the scene is loaded it's
    assigned a name which can be used to access and manipulate the scene
    via various object-related puzzles. By default the assigned name
    equals to the specified scene URL (e.g. 'path/to/scene.gltf'). The
    "alias" option if enabled allows to set the name manually.
    </p>

    [anchor:append_scene]

    <h3>append scene + percentage</h3>

    <p>
    When this puzzle is triggered, a new scene is loaded
    from a specified .gltf file and appended to the current scene.
    After loading is finished, the puzzles in the "when loaded do" slot
    are triggered. Also there can be enabled the "on progress do" slot.
    Puzzles placed in this slot are continuously triggered during the
    loading and can utilize the "percentage" puzzle. The "append scene"
    puzzle doesn't load cameras and lights from a new scene by default.
    This behavior can be changed in the puzzle's options. Once the scene
    is appended it's assigned a name which can be used to access and
    manipulate the scene via various object-related puzzles. By default
    the assigned name equals to the specified scene URL (e.g. 'path/to/scene.gltf').
    The "alias" option if enabled allows to set the name manually.

    [anchor:unload_scene]

    application. Use the empty text value in order to unload all scenes.
    </p>

    [anchor:enable_rendering]

    <h3>enable rendering</h3>

    <p>
    Resumes previously disabled rendering.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scenes-enable-rendering.jpg">



    [anchor:disable_rendering]

    <h3>disable rendering</h3>

    <p>
    Disables rendering. The graphics won't be updated but the user events will be captured and animation timelines will progress.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-scenes-disable-rendering.jpg">

    <p>
    You can use disable rendering for the purpose of saving batteries on mobile
    devices or laptops, and getting rid of cooler noise on desktops. You can
    also enable the *anti-alias* option to significantly increase the rendering
    quality and compensate the loss of performance. This option targets the next
    frame after the rendering stops.
    </p>

    [anchor:create_environment]

    <h3>create environment</h3>

    <p>
      Create a new image-based lighting and assign a background to the scene. This puzzle also creates a new material with the name specified as the first parameter and adds it to the scene. You can use this material to replace textures or colors of the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second parameter can be ether:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>*color*—the environment lighting will be based on the default 256×128 HDR image, the background will be based on the default grey color value.</li>
      <li>*texture*—both the environment lighting and background will be based on the default 256×128 HDR image.</li>
    </ul>

    [anchor:export_to_gltf]

    <h3>export to gltf</h3>

    <p>
      Export your scene, model or a group of models to glTF 2.0 format. Specify the *only visible* option to export only visible objects while the *binary* option is used to export to GLB (glTF Binary) format.
    </p>

    <p>
      For best results, as well as for creating standard glTF files (without Soft8Soft/Verge3D extensions) that can be viewed by third-party glTF viewers (such as Microsoft Windows 10’s default glTF viewer), we recommend you to use glTF-compatible materials. See how to create them in <a href="manual/ru/blender/GLTF-Materials.html">Blender</a>, <a href="manual/ru/max/GLTF-Materials.html">3ds Max</a>, or <a href="manual/ru/maya/GLTF-Materials.html">Maya</a>.
