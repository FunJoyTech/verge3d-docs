  [anchor:Renderers]

  <h2>Renderers</h2>

  <p>
  Verge3D supports two renderers provided by 3ds Max: *Scanline* (default) and *ART* (recommended). The Scanline renderer is intended for use with Standard lights and materials, while the ART is typically used with Photometric lights and Physical materials.
  </p>

  <p>
  Choosing the right renderer is the first thing you should consider before starting to work with graphics. If you are not sure which renderer to choose, we recommend using ART. In order to set the renderer in 3ds Max, use the <a href="manual/zh/max/Viewport-Render-Preview.html#Scanline_ART_Rendering">"Render Setup..."</a> window.
  </p>



  [anchor:Environment_Lighting]

  <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

  <p>
  Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline based on ART/Physical materials. You may illuminate your scene with an environment map alone, without using any light objects (as in the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/gallery/scooter-3d-product-customizer/" target="_blank">Scooter demo</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
  The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch as shown in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_QjxCr8I6k" target="_blank">video</a>.
  </p>



  [anchor:Lights]

  <h2>Lights</h2>

  <p>
  If you'd like to have dynamic shadows in your scene, or if you need to move the source of light (as with car lights), you may utilize <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/3DSMax-Lighting-Shading/files/GUID-57B15284-C5F3-46A8-BBD3-6333FE5E80DE-htm.html" target="_blank">light objects</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Verge3D supports two types of lights provided by 3ds Max: *standard* and *photometric*.
  </p>



  [anchor:Standard_Lights]

  <h3>Standard Lights</h3>

  <p>
  Standard lights are typically used with <a href="manual/zh/max/Materials-Maps-Reference.html#Standard">Standard materials</a>. Verge3D reproduces them by using 3ds Max' Scanline renderer as reference.
  </p>



  [anchor:Photometric_Lights]

  <h3>Photometric Lights</h3>

  <p>
  Photometric lights are typically used with <a href="manual/zh/max/Materials-Maps-Reference.html#Physical">Physical materials</a>. Verge3D reproduces them by using 3ds Max' ART renderer as reference. In addition, you may use Physical Camera <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/3DSMax-Rendering/files/GUID-E1A6D466-CABB-4C8A-97A9-0C191C69F9BD-htm.html" target="_blank">Expose Control</a> settings to tweak the brightness and color range of your renderings.
