    Composes a hidden order form with the "title", "contents" and "total price" fields and an optional screenshot and submits this form to a specified URL according to the specification explicated in the Wordpress Plugin section. By default the order form is submitted to the <a href="https://sandbox.soft8soft.com/order-form/" target="_blank">demo ordering page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Verge3D comes with a free Wordpress plug-in that is able to handle requests submitted by this puzzle. Upon receiving such a request, this Wordpress plug-in renders a page with an extended form supplemented with contact and comments fields, the embedded screenshot and a captcha. Filled out form is finally submitted by the customer and a new order is created in Wordpress admin interface. Both the customer and the sales manager are notified about the order by e-mail.
