    <h1>Scenes</h1>

    <p>
    The puzzles from this category perform loading/unloading operations with scenes.

    <h4>"load scene" + "percentage"</h4>

    <p>
    When this puzzle is triggered, the current scene is unloaded
    and a new scene is loaded from a specified .gltf file. After loading
    is finished, the puzzles in the "when loaded do" slot are triggered.
    Also there can be enabled the "on progress do" slot. Puzzles placed
    in this slot are continuously triggered during the loading and can
    utilize the "percentage" puzzle. Once the scene is loaded it's
    assigned a name which can be used to access and manipulate the scene
    via various object-related puzzles. By default the assigned name
    equals to the specified scene URL (e.g. 'path/to/scene.gltf'). The
    "alias" option if enabled allows to set the name manually.

    <h4>"append scene" + "percentage"</h4>

    <p>
    When this puzzle is triggered, a new scene is loaded
    from a specified .gltf file and appended to the current scene.
    After loading is finished, the puzzles in the "when loaded do" slot
    are triggered. Also there can be enabled the "on progress do" slot.
    Puzzles placed in this slot are continuously triggered during the
    loading and can utilize the "percentage" puzzle. The "append scene"
    puzzle doesn't load cameras and lights from a new scene by default.
    This behavior can be changed in the puzzle's options. Once the scene
    is appended it's assigned a name which can be used to access and
    manipulate the scene via various object-related puzzles. By default
    the assigned name equals to the specified scene URL (e.g. 'path/to/scene.gltf').
    The "alias" option if enabled allows to set the name manually.

    </p>

    <p><a href="manual/zh/puzzles/Scenes.html#enable_rendering" id="enable_rendering" class="permalink">#</a></p>

    <h4>"enable rendering"</h4>

    <p>
    Resumes previously disabled rendering.
    </p>

    <p><a href="manual/zh/puzzles/Scenes.html#disable_rendering" id="disable_rendering" class="permalink">#</a></p>

    <h4>"disable rendering"</h4>

    <p>
    Disables rendering. The graphics won't be updated but the user events will be captured and animation timelines will progress.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can use disable rendering for the purpose of saving batteries on mobile devices or laptops, and getting rid of cooler noise on desktops. You can also use it together with the *supersamping* puzzle to significantly increase the rendering quality and compensate the loss of performance.
    </p>

    <p><a href="manual/zh/puzzles/Scenes.html#create_environment" id="create_environment" class="permalink">#</a></p>

    <h4>"create environment"</h4>

    <p>
      Create a new image-based lighting and assign a background to the scene. This puzzle also creates a new material with the name specified as the first parameter and adds it to the scene. You can use this material to replace textures or colors of the environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second parameter can be ether:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>*color*—the environment lighting will be based on the default 256×128 HDR image, the background will be based on the default grey color value.</li>
      <li>*texture*—both the environment lighting and background will be based on the default 256×128 HDR image.</li>
    </ul>
