    [anchor:call_JS_function]

    <h3>call JS function</h3>

    <p>
    Executes a function specified in the JavaScript code of the application. Optionally passes parameters to be used as function arguments.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-advanced-call-js-function.jpg">

    <p>
    In order to add a function to JavaScript code, open the application <strong>.js</strong> file (for example, <i>my_awesome_app.js</i> located in <i>verge3d/applications/my_awesome_app</i>) with any text editor. Search for "prepareExternalInterface" and add your function inside that declaration (between the curly brackets), so that it looks like this:
    </p>

    <code>
function prepareExternalInterface(app) {
        app.ExternalInterface.myJSFunction = function(numericArg, textArg) {
            alert('Got some params from Puzzles: ' + numericArg + ' and ' + textArg);
        }
}
    </code>



    [anchor:when_called_from_JS]

    <h3>when called from JS</h3>

    <p>
      <span style="color:#f00">Deprecated.</span> Use the *v3d.puzzles.procedures*

      <code>
function runCode(app) {
        v3d.puzzles.procedures['myProcedure']();
}
      </code>
    </p>

    [anchor:save_state]

    <h3>save state</h3>

    <p>

    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-advanced-save-state.jpg">

    <p>
    If this puzzle is called several times, the states are saved in sequence so that it is possible to return to any previous state with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Misc.html#undo_state">undo state</a> puzzle.
    </p>



    [anchor:undo_state]

    <h3>undo state</h3>

    <p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-advanced-undo-state.jpg">

    <p>
    If this puzzle is called several times, the states are restored from the saved sequence (if any) which makes it possible to return to any previously saved state from the stack.
