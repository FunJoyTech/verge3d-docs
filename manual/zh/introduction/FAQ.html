    [anchor:Licensing]

    <h2>Licensing and Support</h2>


    [anchor:download_purchased]

    <h3>I purchased Verge3D. How do I download the watermark-free version?</h3>

    <p>
    After purchase (in minutes or hours depending on your time zone) you will be sent an email with your license key. Copy this key and paste it in the App Manager's *License Information* panel. This will make your Verge3D trial bundle a licensed copy and will remove the watermark from your projects.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, if you purchased the Enterprise version, you can download the special DevKit distribution containing the source code of Verge3D. To get it, go to your <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/my-account/" target="_blank">dashboard</a> at soft8soft.com and click *Downloads* button. The same applies to all material packs purchased from Soft8Soft.
    </p>

    [anchor:how_many_computers]

    <h3>On how many computers can Verge3D be installed? How many users can use a single license?</h3>

    <p>
    The license is assigned on the per person (Freelance) or per entity (Team, Enterprise) basis. The number of installations is not limited. In case of the Freelance option, only one individual can use Verge3D. On the other hand, there is no limitation on the number of users within the company or organization.
    </p>

    [anchor:trial]

    <h3>What are the limitations / restrictions of the Verge3D Trial? Can I do ... ?</h3>

    <p>The trial version is intended for evaluation purposes only. You must not use in production environments, either for commercial or non-commercial purposes.</span></p>

    <p>So, you can practice you skills with the trial version. You can create a mock-up presentation for your managers. You cannot use it for education - <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/contact/" target="_blank">reach us</a> to request a special Educational license at reduced price. And you cannot build up your portfolio with the trial as this qualifies as production use - be sure to purchase the Verge3D Freelance license for that.</p>

    <p>See <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/verge3d-trial/" target="_blank">this page</a> for more info about benefits and limitations of the Verge3D Trial version.</p>

    [anchor:tech_support]

    <h3>How do I obtain technical support?</h3>

    <p>
    If you own a Verge3D Team or Freelance license, or still evaluating Verge3D, you can purchase our <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-tech-support-and-consulting-plan/" target="_blank">support plan</a>.

    </p>


    [anchor:General_Questions]

    <h2>General Questions</h2>

    [anchor:what_is_webgl]

    <h3>What is WebGL?</h3>

    <p>WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a technology for rendering interactive 3D graphics within the browser. WebGL works right on a website - whether it is accessed from a desktop or a smartphone - without installing additional software. However, this is a geeky tech and it would require a lot of time and expertise even to just render a rotating cube. By hiding all this complicated stuff, Verge3D allows a non-coder - an artist, an engineer or an educator - to create rich web-based interactives with ease.</p>


    [anchor:roadmap]

    <h3>Where can I find the roadmap for Verge3D development?</h3>

    <p>Verge3D is a client-oriented product so we move in the direction our customers <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/forum/bug-reports-and-feature-requests/" target="_blank">want us to</a>. In general, our priorities are e-commerce, e-learning, and AR/VR applications. If you have a specific feature in mind that you'd like to see in Verge3D, we can add it on a contract basis. Feel free to <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/contact/" target="_blank">reach us</a> to discuss details.

    [anchor:internet_connection]

    <h3>Do I need Internet connection to work with Verge3D?</h3>

    <p>
      Verge3D is a pure offline toolkit which operates on local files stored on a computer's hard drive. Finished projects can be deployed on your own website, converted to a mobile or desktop application or served via local network. The only feature that requires Internet connection is publishing on Verge3D Network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, to help users with unstable or low-band internet connection, we ship offline versions of Verge3D User Manual and Developer Reference. Find these in the *docs* directory of your Verge3D distribution.
    </p>

    [anchor:app_browser_security]

    <h3>My app does not load when I open it in Chrome - yet it works when running from the App Manager or if opened in Firefox...</h3>

    <p>
    Due to security policy imposed by browser vendors, web applications cannot access data loaded from another domain, including from a local file system (with Firefox being an exception here). Therefore, you should use the App Manager (which comes with a local server) for development, or publish your Verge3D apps on a web server (or upload to the Verge3D Network) to be able to run it.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you need a desktop or mobile application instead, you can convert your Verge3D apps to those platforms using third-party software (such <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a> or <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a>).
    </p>


    [anchor:app_double_click]

    <h3>Cannot load app when I launch it by clicking on the .html file.</h3>

    <p>See the answer on the question <a href="manual/zh/introduction/FAQ.html#app_browser_security">above</a>.</p>

    [anchor:standalone_html]

    <h3>Can I export my scene to a standalone all-in HTML file?</h3>

    <p>
    Nope, there is no all-in HTML format offered by Verge3D. If you need a standalone executable you can try to convert it with <a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a>.
    </p>

    [anchor:cinema4d]

    <h3>Any plans to support Maxon Cinema 4D? Sketchup?</h3>

    <p>See the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/topic/verge3d-for-cinema4d-call-for-discussion/" target="_blank">answer to this question</a> on the forums.</p>

    [anchor:ie11]

    <h3>Do Verge3D apps work in Internet Explorer 11?</h3>

    <p>
    Yes. Enable IE 11 compatibility module in the app creation panel.
    </p>

    <img src="files/faq/ie11-compat-module.jpg" alt="Enabling Internet Explorer 11 support" class="centered" style="max-width: 358px">


    [anchor:app_manager_standalone]

    <h3>Is it possible to run the App Manager without Blender, 3ds Max or Maya?</h3>

    <p>
      Sure, you can run the App Manager in standalone mode. Simply click on the corresponding <em>Verge3D</em> icon from the desktop or start menu. This launcher will also open your default browser and automatically navigate to the App Manager.
    </p>

    [anchor:copy_puzzles]

    <h3>How can I copy Puzzles into another project?</h3>

    <p>
    You can use the <a href="manual/zh/puzzles/Library.html">Library</a> feature for that.
    </p>


    [anchor:no_sound_ios]

    <h3>Sound is not played on iOS...</h3>

    <p>
    See how to fix that <a href="manual/zh/introduction/Workflow.html#Audio_">here</a>.

    [anchor:slow_app]

    <h3>My app is laggy and slow. How do I increase its performance?</h3>

    <p>Check out this <a href="manual/zh/introduction/Optimizing-WebGL-performance.html">assets optimization guide</a>.</p>



    [anchor:Modelling]

    <h2>Modelling and Content Creation</h2>

    [anchor:what_is_gltf]

    <h3>What is glTF?</h3>

    <p>glTF is a universal web-friendly file format which is used to store and interchange 3D graphics data in Verge3D and other 3D software. It can store not just models but entire scenes, including geometry data (meshes), object positions, animations, camera data, lights, materials, textures and other info.</p>

    <p>The glTF format specifies only a basic set of features. Thus, we extended this format with several extensions (prefixed S8S). Verge3D's subset of glTF supports not only the basic PBR materials, but also Blender and 3ds Max node-based materials, cameras, lights, environment and other things, making your asset workflow easier and more efficient.</p>

    <p class="note">
      In Verge3D we use the 2.0 version of the glTF format. Using the older 1.0 version is not recommended.
    </p>

    [anchor:gltf_materials]

    <h3>In what cases should I use glTF-compatible materials?</h3>

    <p>There are some benefits in using <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0#materials" target="_blank">glTF-compatible</a> PBR materials over 3ds Max or Blender's native node-based system:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In many cases, glTF materials work faster, making them a good choice for low-end devices.</li>
      <li>The shaders are compiled quicker thus speeding up the application startup.</li>
      <li>Thanks to their simplicity, glTF-compatible materials are much easier to create. They are also supported natively in the popular material designers such as Substance Painter.</li>
      <li>Last but not least, these materials will work properly in other software which supports assets in glTF format.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The main drawback of using glTF-compliant materials is that you can't use the native material system provided by 3ds Max or Blender. As such, it might be difficult to achieve the same level of quality for your renderings.</p>

    <p>Check out the following guides for more info:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="manual/zh/max/GLTF-Materials.html">Creating glTF-compatible materials in 3ds Max</a></li>
      <li><a href="manual/zh/blender/GLTF-Materials.html">Creating glTF-compatible materials in Blender</a></li>
    </ul>

    [anchor:gltf_or_glb]

    <h3>Which 3D format is better glTF or GLB?</h3>

    <p>These are the two variations of the same glTF 2.0 format. glTF container is more popular and more efficient since it stores only metadata (parameters of your scenes/objects/materials etc). All external data, such as geometry, animation and textures are stored separately (in *.bin, *.jpeg, *.png files).</p>
    <p>The GLB container stores all data in the binary form and packs metadata, geometry, animation and textures into one big file. As such, GLB can be is more convenient since you don't need to deal with a bunch of files.</p>


    [anchor:black_rendering]

    <h3>When I export my scene to Verge3D I see nothing (or just the background).</h3>

    <p>This may happen due to various reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>You camera is not configured properly. Check out its <em>near</em> and <em>far</em> clipping distances as well as the target point (if your camera has the <em>Orbit</em> controls type).</li>
      <li>This could be <em>backface culling</em> or normals pointing in wrong direction. Check your materials and normals.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it can be an issue with your hardware or a software bug preventing geometry to be rendered. Check out the browser console and see if there any errors reported.</li>
    </ul>

    [anchor:supported_3d_formats]

    <h3>What 3D formats can be used with Verge3D?</h3>

    <p>
    Verge3D is able to load various formats including glTF, OBJ, FBX, COLLADA, STL and PLY. Still, the preferred way to create 3D web content is to use glTF 2.0 format which is supported by both 3ds Max and Blender exporters.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, the script of the Standard application template is based on the [page:App] class which supports loading glTF files only. For loading other formats, use the corresponding <a href="https://cdn.soft8soft.com/demo/examples/index.html?q=loader" target="_blank">loaders</a> instead.
    </p>


    [anchor:solidworks_to_webgl]

    <h3>How do I convert my SolidWorks model to WebGL using your software?</h3>

    <p>As of 2016 version, 3ds Max supports SolidWorks assets natively. Simply <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/3DSMax-Data-Exchange/files/GUID-861F1B25-0F1B-4E79-A660-821F4CD2175B-htm.html" target="_blank">import your SolidWorks file</a> into 3ds Max and then export to WebGL as any other Max scene.</p>
    <p>Note: Pay attention to geometry optimization since CAD models tend to be quite heavy for the web. Tweak *Mesh Resolution* setting from the *Import Settings* dialog when importing your files. You can also use 3ds Max modifiers to reduce the number of polygons on your models.</p>
    <img src="files/faq/import-cad-model.jpg" alt="SolidWorks-to-Max import dialog" class="centered" style="max-width: 247px">

    [anchor:revit_to_webgl]

    <h3>How to create realtime browser visualization based on a Revit model?</h3>

    <p>You have two options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Export your Revit model to FBX format and then import to 3ds Max or Blender.</li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/3DSMax-Data-Exchange/files/GUID-14B2A55F-5C22-4FA2-A31E-554E2400FB52-htm.html" target="_blank">Revit importer</a> which supported natively in 3ds Max. Don't forget to activate <em>Autodesk Revit Interoperability</em> option during Max installation to enable this feature.</li>
    </ol>

    <img src="files/faq/import-revit-model.jpg" alt="Importing Revit model to 3ds Max" class="centered" style="max-width: 349px">

    <p>In any case keep your geometry optimized. We recommend using 100K-500K polygons for the entire scene.</p>



    [anchor:Programming_Questions]

    <h2>Programming Questions</h2>


    [anchor:threejs_compatibility]

    <h3>You say Verge3D is based on Three.js. Is it compatible with Three.js API?</h3>

    <p>
    To create Verge3D we modified Three.js code base a lot and thus we decided to use "v3d" prefix for our APIs. However, we'll try to maintain source code compatibility with Three.js. Most of the Three.js-based applications and <a href="https://cdn.soft8soft.com/demo/examples/index.html" target="_blank">examples</a> should work in Verge3D without any modifications.
    </p>

    [anchor:preserve_scale_on_resize]

    <h3>How can scene scale be preserved on resize?</h3>

    <p>
      We want all objects, regardless of their distance from the camera, to appear the same size, even as the window is resized.

      The key equation to solving this is this formula for the visible height at a given distance:

      <code>
        visible_height = 2 * Math.tan((Math.PI / 180) * camera.fov / 2) * distance_from_camera;
      </code>
      If we increase the window height by a certain percentage, then what we want is the visible height at all distances
      to increase by the same percentage.

      This can not be done by changing the camera position. Instead you have to change the camera field-of-view.
      [link:http://jsfiddle.net/Q4Jpu/ Example].
    </p>


    [anchor:app_endless_growing_ios]

    <h3>My app window grows endlessly on iOS devices. How to fix it?</h3>
    <p>
      <p>
        If you embed a Verge3D application inside an iframe element, you may run
        into a specific issue on iOS devices, which causes iframes to constantly
        increase in size beyond the boundaries of the browser window. This in turn
        can lead to a WebGL crash.
      </p>

      <p>
        To deal with this issue you can use the following snippet, which resizes
        the iframe to the page's body preventing the said iframe from extending
        beyond it.
      </p>

      <code>
      &lt;script&gt;
    if (/(iPad|iPhone|iPod)/g.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        var iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');
        function resize() {
            iframe.style.width = getComputedStyle(document.body).width;
            iframe.style.height = getComputedStyle(document.body).height;
            iframe.setAttribute('scrolling', 'no');
        }
        iframe.addEventListener('resize', function(e) {
            resize();
        });

        resize();
    }
    &lt;/script&gt;
      </code>
    </p>


    [anchor:keyboard_not_working]

    <h3>Keyboard controls does not work for the app embedded in iframe.</h3>
    <p>
      It happens when some other HTML on your page gets the focus. To fix this issue try the following code:
      <code>
        document.getElementById("my_iframe_id").focus();
      </code>
      Where <strong>my_iframe_id</strong> is the ID of your iframe element.
    </p>
