    <h1>Blend Shapes (aka Morphing) / Maya</h1>

    <p>
      Blend Shapes (called Morphing in Verge3D) is a feature which allows you to modify mesh objects in real-time. The most common use case for this feature is facial animation. Morphing also suits well to creating parametric objects which can interactively change their dimensions, shape, thickness, holes, profiles etc.
    </p>

    <p>See the following demo as an example:</p>

    <h2>Setting up</h2>

    <p>
      In Maya, open the <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-CharacterAnimation/files/GUID-3C92402C-B24E-4874-AC8D-EADF976A19DC-htm.html" target="_blank">Shape Editor</a>, and setup targets for your objects. Please notice that due to hardware constraints, you can create only one blend shape with total number of active targets limited to 6. During rendering, the engine selects 6 shape targets with largest influences ignoring all excessive targets.
    </p>

    <h2>Animating Blend Shapes</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports keyframe animation of blend shape weights. Check out the <a href="manual/zh/maya/Animation.html#Blend_Shape_Animation">Animation</a> section for more details.
    </p>


    <h2>Controlling via Puzzles</h2>

    <p>
      To manipulate your morph targets in real-time there are two puzzles: <a href="manual/zh/puzzles/Objects.html#get_morph_factor">get morph factor</a> and <a href="manual/zh/puzzles/Objects.html#set_morph_factor">set morph factor</a>.
