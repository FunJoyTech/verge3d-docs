    <h1>Lighting and Rendering / 3ds Max</h1>

    <p>
    This page contains the information about 3ds Max' lighting and rendering settings which can be used with Verge3D.
    </p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:renderers]

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports three renderers provided by 3ds Max: *Scanline*, *ART*, and *Arnold* (recommended). The Scanline renderer is intended for use with Standard lights and materials, while the ART/Arnold is typically used with Photometric lights and Physical materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing the right renderer is the first thing you should consider before starting to work with graphics. If you are not sure which renderer to choose, we recommend using Arnold. In order to set the renderer in 3ds Max, use the <a href="manual/en/max/Viewport-Render-Preview.html#Scanline_ART_Rendering">"Render Setup..."</a> window.
    </p>



    [anchor:environment_lighting]

    <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline based on Physical materials. You may illuminate your scene with an environment map alone, without using any light objects (as in the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/gallery/scooter-3d-product-customizer/" target="_blank">Scooter demo</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
    The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch as shown in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_QjxCr8I6k" target="_blank">video</a>.
    </p>



    [anchor:lights]

    <h2>Lights</h2>

    <p>
    If you'd like to have dynamic shadows in your scene, or if you need to move the source of light (as with car lights), you may utilize <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/3DSMax-Lighting-Shading/files/GUID-57B15284-C5F3-46A8-BBD3-6333FE5E80DE-htm.html" target="_blank">light objects</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Verge3D supports two types of lights provided by 3ds Max: *standard* and *photometric*.
    </p>


    [anchor:photometric_lights]

    <h3>Photometric Lights</h3>

    <p>
      Photometric lights are typically used with <a href="manual/en/max/Materials-Maps-Reference.html#Physical">Physical materials</a>. Verge3D reproduces them by using 3ds Max' Arnold renderer as reference. In addition, you may use Physical Camera <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/3DSMax-Rendering/files/GUID-E1A6D466-CABB-4C8A-97A9-0C191C69F9BD-htm.html" target="_blank">Expose Control</a> settings to tweak the brightness and color range of your renderings.
    </p>


    [anchor:standard_lights]

    <h3>Standard Lights</h3>

    <p>
      Standard lights are typically used with <a href="manual/en/max/Materials-Maps-Reference.html#Standard">Standard materials</a>. Verge3D reproduces them by using 3ds Max' Scanline renderer as reference.
    </p>


    [anchor:light_probes]

    <h2>Reflection Cubemap Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D add-on adds a custom light probe object called *V3DReflectionCubemap*,
      which can be used to apply indirect lighting to objects via a local
      reflection cubemap.
    </p>

    <iframe class="video-480p" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J3gV2zpvgwo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    [demo:light_probe]

    <p>
      The object can be found in the *Create* panel -> *Helpers* category ->
      *Verge3D* subcategory:

    <img src="files/lighting-max/light-probe-reflection-cubemap-create.png" style="max-width: 351px">

    <p>
      A reflection cubemap object defines a volume of influence represented by
      a box or a sphere. All objects contained inside that volume will use a
      local reflection cubemap generated in runtime instead of the scene's
      global environment texture/color.<br/><br/>

      The advantage of using a local reflection map is that it has surrounding
      objects baked in it, while the scene's global map only contains the
      background texture/color specified in Max's environment settings. Local
      reflection maps also have a parallax effect depending on the geometry of
      the <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#influence_volume">influence</a>
      or <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#parallax_volume">parallax</a>

    [anchor:ambient_occlusion]

    <h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>

    <p>
      Ambient Occlusion is a rendering technique that improves a scene's realism
      by adding soft shadows from indirect (ambient) lighting based on how much
      the point is exposed to the light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D implements Ground Truth Ambient Occlusion (GTAO), which settings
      you can find in the *AO* section of *Verge3D Export Settings* (accessible
      through <strong>Verge3D->Export Settings...</strong> in 3ds Max menu):
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/ambient-occlusion-properties.png" style="max-width: 272px">

    <p class="note">
      Verge3D adds the ambient occlusion effect only for *Physical Material*
      nodes and only if the scene has <a href="manual/en/max/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#environment_lighting">environment lighting</a>
      (either as a color or a map).
    </p>

      <dt>Distance</dt>
      <dd>
        The radius (in system units) within which to calculate ambient occlusion.
        Higher values make the effect more noticeable by over-darkening and
        expanding the area of it, but also can decrease performance. Lower
        values make occlusion less noticeable.
      </dd>
      <dt>Factor</dt>
      <dd>
        The strength of the occlusion effect.
      </dd>
      <dt>Trace Precision</dt>
      <dd>
        Higher precision means more accurate occlusion at increased performance

        less prominent.
      </dd>
      <dt>Bent Normals</dt>
      <dd>
        Use modified (or "bent") normals to sample the environment instead of
        the original ones. The modified normals represent the least occluded
        direction and make environment lighting a bit more realistic.
      </dd>
    </dl>


    [anchor:outline_rendering]

    <h2>Outline Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      Outline rendering (aka silhouette edge rendering) is a common non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technique that can significantly enhance the visual perception of your scene. This effect can be used for various applications such as e-learning, games, architecture visualization, and technical drawing.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-example.jpg" style="max-width: 819px">

    <p>
      To use object outlining (and optional glowing) in your Verge3D application, first enable the effect in the *Verge3D Export Settings* dialog:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/outline-settings.jpg" style="max-width: 272px">

    <p>
      then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#outline">outline</a> puzzle to apply it to your object(s).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The outline rendering does not work inside AR/VR sessions. Use other methods to highlight your objects, such as animation or changing material's color.
    </p>

    <p>You can tweak outlining using the following properties:</p>

    <p>*Enabled* — enable/disable the effect.</p>

    <p>*Edge Strength* — outlining strength factor.</p>

    <p>*Edge Glow* — intensity of additional glowing (rendered beyond the main outline edge).</p>

    <p>*Edge Thickness* — outline edge thickness factor.</p>

    <p>*Pulse Period* — pulse period in seconds. Specify to make the effect animated.</p>

    <p>*Visible Edge Color* — visible edge color.</p>

    <p>*Hidden Edge Color* — color of the outline edge being rendered behind any other scene objects.</p>

    <p>*Render Hidden Edge* — enable/disable rendering of the outline edge behind other scene objects.</p>

    <p class="note">Though it's possible to render glowing objects, in the most cases the outline rendering is used to improve visual clarity of your scene. If you need glowing from lamps or another bright objects, consider using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Postprocessing.html#bloom">bloom post-processing</a> instead.</p>

    [anchor:hidpi_rendering]

    <h2>Rendering on HiDPI (Retina) Screens</h2>

    <p>
      As of today, most mobile and many desktop screens have high pixel density (so called "Retina" displays). These displays allow you to substantially increase quality of your renderings. The downside of rendering many pixels is reduced performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two approaches how to make your content look better and do not make your scenes really slow:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using somewhat better resolution, e.g by setting screen scaling factor to 1.5 or so. See <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#set_screen_scale">here</a> for more info.</li>
      <li>Using HiDPI rendering only for important content, such as text, screen-space UI elements, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The latter approach can be easily achieved by enabling the *HiDPI Compositing* property located on the *Verge3D Adv. Rendering Params* panel:

      <em>Fit to Camera Edge</em> is a technique to draw screen-space UI elements based on 3ds Max models. This approach to UI design is more “native” to the 3D artist than using HTML/CSS, and does not require external tools. But there is more in it: since the UI elements are genuine 3D objects, you can apply shaders, lighting, animation, morphing – you name it – making them truly interactive and seamlessly integrated into the scene.

    <p>
      When you parent some object to the camera, the following settings appear on the *Verge3D Adv. Rendering Params* panel:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Horizontal</dt>
      <dd>
        Horizontal canvas edge to fit object to. *None* — no horizontal fit, *Left* — fit to left edge, *Right* — fit to right edge, *Stretch* — scale object horizontally to fit on the screen.
      </dd>
      <dt>Vertical</dt>
      <dd>
        Vertical canvas edge to fit object to. *None* — no vertical fit, *Top* — fit to top edge, *Bottom* — fit to bottom edge, *Stretch* — scale object vertically to fit on the screen.
      </dd>
      <dt>Shape</dt>
      <dd>
        Canvas fit shape. *Box* — use object's bounding box, *Sphere* — use object's bounding sphere to fit the object on the screen.
      </dd>
      <dt>Fit Offset</dt>
      <dd>
        Additional offset used to fit object on the screen. Effectively, this value extends object bounding (box or sphere) by the specified absolute value.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Visibility Breakpoints</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Visibility Breakpoints</em> allow you to show/hide content depending on 3D viewport width/height or orientation settings. The most important use case of this feature — adapting your scene to different screen sizes and orientations. E.g you may have two different models for portrait and landscape screen orientations.
    </p>

    <p>
      If assigned to the current camera, tries to switch to an alternative camera (must have acceptable visibility breakpoints) in the scene, if no alternative camera is found, does nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can configure the breakpoints on the *Verge3D Adv. Rendering Params* panel:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/visibility-breakpoints.jpg" style="max-width: 362px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Min Width</dt>
      <dd>
        Minimum canvas width the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Max Width</dt>
      <dd>
        Maximum canvas width the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Min Height</dt>
      <dd>
        Minimum canvas height the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Max Height</dt>
      <dd>
        Maximum canvas height the object stays visible.
      </dd>
      <dt>Orientation</dt>
      <dd>
        Screen orientation the object stays visible.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Clipping Planes</h2>

    <p>
      Clipping planes (aka section planes, cross-section planes, mesh sections) is a technique used to show internal arrangement of complex objects, such as buildings, cars, appliances, gadgets, machines etc.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/clipping-plane-example.jpg">

    <p>
      To add a new clipping plane, use the <strong>Create -> Helpers -> Verge3D -> ClippingPlane</strong> button in 3ds Max:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-max/clipping-plane-new.jpg" style="max-width: 311px">

    <p>
      The objects on your scene will be clipped in the negative *Z* direction of the clipping plane object.
    </p>

    [demo:clipping_planes]

    <p>
      Clipping planes have the following parameters:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Affected Objects</dt>
      <dd>
        Selection set of the objects clipped by the plane. If empty, all scene objects will be clipped.
      </dd>
      <dt>Negated</dt>
      <dd>
        Swap clipped and unclipped sides.
      </dd>
      <dt>Clip Shadows</dt>
      <dd>
        Clip shadows cast from the clipped objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Union Planes</dt>
      <dd>
        Construct a union from all the clipping planes, affecting the object, not their intersection.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section</dt>
      <dd>
        Fill cross-section between the clipping plane and the affected objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section Color</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section diffuse color and opacity.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Sect. Size</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section plane size. Increase this value if you use larger scene size.
      </dd>
    </dl>
