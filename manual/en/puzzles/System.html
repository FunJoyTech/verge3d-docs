    <h1>System Puzzles</h1>

    <p>
    These puzzles may be used to perform various system functions such as printing to console, measuring performance, getting/setting rendered pixel ratio and retrieving the GPU information.

    [anchor:print_to_console]

    <h3>print to console</h3>

    <p>
      Prints data of any type (an output from some puzzle, a variable, or just a text) to the browser <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#browser_console">console</a>. Printing to console is the most universal and easy-to-use method to debug your scripts.
    </p>

    [anchor:print_performance_info]

    <h3>print performance info</h3>

    <p>
    Records a performance profile during 1 second and prints it to the browser <a href="manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#browser_console">console</a>. Use this profile to find performance bottlenecks and improve application rendering and loading speed. See more <a href="manual/en/introduction/Performance-Bottlenecks.html#performance_profile">here</a>.
    </p>

    [anchor:check_performance]

    <h3>check performance</h3>

    <p>
      Measure rendering capabilities of the user’s computer or device. Under the hood, it uses the open source library <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/detect-gpu" target="_blank">Detect GPU</a> to quickly run a benchmark and classify the user’s GPU as “good” or “poor”.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-check-performance.jpg">

    <p>
      You can use this puzzle’s slots to load a simpler scene, or to disable some graphically intensive features (such as post-processing effects) for poor GPUs. On the other hand – if the user’s GPU appears to be powerful – you can boost the quality up.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also added this benchmark to the <a href="http://soft8soft.com/webglreport" target="_blank">WebGL Report</a> page so that you can quickly check your GPU by simply opening this page in the browser.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/webgl-report-performance-output.png" style="max-width: 705px">

    <p class="note">
      If the user's GPU reported as "good" it does not mean you can overload it by heavy graphics. You still need to do as much as possible to optimize your app!
    </p>


    [anchor:feature_available]

    <h3>feature available</h3>

    <p>
    Check if a feature selected from the drop-down is available in the user's browser.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-feature-available.jpg">


    [anchor:get_GPU]

    <h3>get GPU</h3>

    <p>
    Outputs the user's GPU info - vendor, for example: NVIDIA Corporation, Apple Inc., Qualcomm, and GPU model, for example: GeForce GTX 1060 3GB/PCIe/SSE2, Apple A9 GPU, Adreno (TM) 330.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-get-GPU.jpg">


    [anchor:set_screen_scale]

    <h3>set screen scale</h3>

    <p>
      Set screen resolution factor for the rendered canvas. Set &gt; 1 to improve quality, &lt; 1 to improve performance. 1 is the default screen scale on both retina (aka HiDPI) and non-retina displays.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-set-screen-scale.jpg">

    <p class="note">To prevent rendering of too much pixels on retina displays, Verge3D uses 1 as default scale factor. If performance is not a concern, enable retina rendering by setting screen scale to native screen scale.</p>


    [anchor:native_screen_scale]

    <h3>native screen scale</h3>

    <p>
      Native (depends on hardware or browser zooming) canvas resolution factor. If you don't <em>zoom in</em> or <em>zoom out</em> your page, this value equals to 1 for non-retina displays, &gt; 1 for HiDPI displays, modern smartphones and tablets.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-native-screen-scale.jpg">


    [anchor:detect_gamepad]

    <h3>detect gamepad device</h3>

    <p>
      Detect gamepad devices connected to or disconnected from your system. When a new gamepad device found, the puzzles specified in the "once connected do" slot are triggered. When the device disconnected, the puzzles specified in the "once disconnected do" slot are triggered. In any case the value "gamepad index" is set and returns the device index.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-detect-gamepad.jpg">


    [anchor:gamepad_index]

    <h3>gamepad index</h3>

    <p>
      Returns connected/disconnected gamepad device index.
    </p>


    [anchor:get_gamepad_prop]

    <h3>get gamepad property</h3>

    <p>
      Returns a gamepad property for the device with the given index.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-get-gamepad-prop.jpg" style="max-width: 951px">

    <p>Properties:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>*connection status* — whether the device is connected (returns <em>true</em>) or disconnected (returns <em>false</em>).</li>
      <li>*axis* — device axis position in the range <em>-1.0–1.0</em>. For example, an analog thumb stick found on all recent gamepads is represented by two axes: left–right and up–down.</li>
      <li>*button* — device button state. Returns <em>true</em> when the button is pressed and <em>false</em> otherwise.</li>
      <li>*analog button* — analog button state. Similar to button but can detect the amount which the button has been pressed. Returns value in the range <em>0–1</em>.</li>
      <li>*id* — device ID string. Identifies the brand and model of the connected device.</li>
      <li>*timestamp* — last time the axes/buttons for the gamepad were updated. You can store this value in a variable and compare with the current timestamp each frame to detect that some axis/angle was changed.</li>
      <li>*debug info* — output string with debugging information. Print this info with <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#print_to_console">print to console</a> puzzle to learn what buttons or sticks are available on the connected gamepad device.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To assign axes buttons in your application use the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/gamepad_diagnostics/gamepad_diagnostics.html" target="_blank">Gamepad Diagnostics</a> tool, *debug info* property or follow the Standard Gamepad layout (does not work properly for all kinds of devices):</p>

    [anchor:local_storage_set]

    <h3>storage set</h3>

    <p>
      Stores key-value pairs in the web browser's local storage with no expiration time. This means that data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed. Note: the local storage of web browser in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.
      The key must be a text. The following data types are supported as an assigned value: number, text, list, dictionary.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-local-storage-set.jpg">


    [anchor:local_storage_get]

    <h3>storage get</h3>

    <p>
      Returns an value associated with a specified key in the web browser's local storage.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-local-storage-get.jpg">


    [anchor:local_storage_remove]

    <h3>storage remove</h3>

    <p>
      Removes an value associated with a specified key in the web browser's local storage.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-system-local-storage-remove.jpg">


    [anchor:local_storage_check]

    <h3>storage check</h3>

    <p>
      Checks if a specified key is present in the web browser's local storage. Returns the Boolean-typed result *true* or *false*.
    </p>
