    <h3>load sound</h3>

    <p>
      Loads an audio file using a specified URL. The audio is played via the HTML5
      Audio tag or WebAudio API depending on the chosen type: <b>music</b> or
      <b>sound</b> respectively. This puzzle also adds the loaded audio to a
      memory cache so that any subsequent uses of this puzzle with the same URL
      do not load the same sound file again. Using <strong>.mp3</strong> format
      is recommended as it is supported by most web browsers.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-load-sound.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p id="load_sound_preloading"><b>preloading audio</b></p>
    <p>
      Audio files take some time to load, so they are not available immediately.
      That's why simply using this puzzle inside the
      <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Sound.html#play">play</a> puzzle may not work
      and the audio may not start playing.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to be sure that audio in your application works properly it's
      recommended to load audio files beforehand, for example, in the
      <a href="manual/en/introduction/Puzzles-Visual-Logic-Editor.html#Tabs">init</a>
      tab which is executed before a Verge3D application is initialized. You can
      also use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Advanced.html#connector">connector</a>
      puzzle to organize a bunch of "load sound" puzzles in a bit more
      convenient way:
    </p>

    <img class="centered" src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-preload-init.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px">
    <span class="img-caption">Preloading audio in the "init" tab.</span>

    <p>
      After that using the preloaded audio files either in the
      <a href="manual/en/introduction/Puzzles-Visual-Logic-Editor.html#Tabs">main</a>
      and user-created tabs shouldn't cause any issues, since the audio is already
      cached after the first use of the "load sound" puzzle, hence it doesn't
      need to be downloaded again:
    </p>

    <p><b>autoplay restrictions</b></p>
    <p>
      In general, audio playback initiated programmatically (as in the case of
      puzzles) will most likely be blocked by a browser. This happens due to
      autoplay policies that restrict how audio can be played automatically on
      a web page. The purpose of such restrictions is to stop web pages from
      making spontaneous noises or playing audio when it's not desired, thus
      improving overall user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although, such policies can be implemented differently in various browsers
      and also can have various conditions for allowing / not allowing autoplay, the general
      rule for playing audio is to wait for the user to interact with your web
      page.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cases where such interaction is already implied by the application's
      logic, for example, playing a sound on click (be it either a 3d-object or
      an HTML button), those restrictions are not what you should worry about.
      But, let's say that you want your application to have some background
      music that starts playing when the app is loaded. Since that can not
      always be done in an automatic way, a good solution would be to make a
      "launch" button for starting the app when it's loaded and ready. Clicking
      it counts as a user interaction and allows to start audio playback.
    </p>

    <p><b>"music" vs "sound" audio type</b></p>
    <p>
      This puzzle allows you to choose which API to use for loading and playing
      audio files.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>music</b> (default, HTML5 Audio tag) - should be used most of
          the time; suits better for long audio files, e.g. background music
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>sound</b> (WebAudio API) - suits better for short audio files, e.g.
          small sound effects; it's recommended to use this type only in the
          following cases:
          <ul>
              <li>
                short looped (see the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Sound.html#play">play</a>
                puzzle and its <b>loop</b> option) sound effects - "sound" makes
                looped audio seamless, while with "music" you have a noticeable
                delay
              </li>
              <li>
                sound effects that should be played immediately, e.g. on
                user interaction, experience a delay on Safari - "sound" fixes
                this issue
              </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-load-sound-type.jpg" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p class="note">
      Web Audio API which is utilized by the <b>sound</b> type is supported in most
      modern browsers. However, if you need your audio to work in browsers with
      no Web Audio support (e.g. Internet Explorer 11) you have to use the
      <b>music</b> type.
      <br/><br/>

      If it's necessary to use the <b>sound</b> type in browsers where it is
      available and also support Internet Explorer 11 at the same time, then the
      recommended solution is to use the
      <a href="manual/en/puzzles/System.html#feature_available">feature available</a>
      puzzle with the <b>Web Audio API</b> option selected to check if the API
      is available or not and load audio with the <b>music</b> or the <b>sound</b>
      type depending on that. You can do that for both
      <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Sound.html#load_sound_preloading">preloading</a> and
      playing audio in a way shown below:

    [anchor:load_video]

    <h3>load video</h3>

    <p>
      Creates an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp" target="_blank">HTML5 video</a> element and loads a sound file using a specified URL. This puzzle also adds the created video element to a memory cache so that any subsequent uses of this puzzle with the same URL do not load the same sound file again. Using <strong>.mp4</strong> format is recommended as it is supported by most web browsers.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-load-video.jpg">

    <p>The *load video* puzzle does not create any visible elements on your scene. To make it visible, assign video texture to your materials using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Materials.html#replace_texture">replace texture</a> puzzle.</p>


    <!-- COMPAT: < 3.1.1 -->
    <a href="#" id="play_sound"></a>

    [anchor:play]

    <h3>play</h3>

    <p>Starts audio or video playback. The *loop* checkbox repeats playback if enabled.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-play.jpg" style="max-width: 722px">

    <p>Due to browser restrictions (preventing malicious websites from playing noisy sounds and videos) you should not execute this puzzle to play your assets automatically (upon scene loading). Instead, you should do this in some user-generated event. Use <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Events.html#when_clicked">when clicked</a> or <a href="manual/en/puzzles/HTML.html#event">event</a> to handle such events.</p>

    <p class="note">There is one exception to this rule. Browsers allow playing muted videos automatically. See the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Sound.html#mute">mute</a> puzzle.</p>


    <!-- COMPAT: < 3.1.1 -->
    <a href="#" id="pause_sound"></a>

    [anchor:pause]

    <h3>pause</h3>

    <p>Pauses audio or video playback.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-pause.jpg" style="max-width: 459px">


    <!-- COMPAT: < 3.1.1 -->
    <a href="#" id="stop_sound"></a>

    [anchor:stop]

    <h3>stop</h3>

    <p>Stops audio or video playback. Using this puzzle is equivalent to using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Sound.html#pause">pause</a> puzzle, followed by the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Sound.html#rewind">rewind</a> puzzle.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-stop.jpg">


    <!-- COMPAT: < 3.1.1 -->
    <a href="#" id="rewind_sound"></a>

    [anchor:rewind]

    <h3>rewind</h3>

    <p>Makes the audio or video asset to play from the start.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-rewind.jpg" style="max-width: 459px">


    [anchor:rewind]

    <h3>set playback rate</h3>

    <p>Set audio/video playback rate. Specify value &lt;1 to slow down playback, 1 for normal speed, and &gt;1 to increase playback speed.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-set-playback-rate.jpg">


    [anchor:set_volume]

    <h3>set volume</h3>

    <p>Sets the sound volume. Input volume is clamped to the 0.0-1.0 range. This puzzle also works for videos with embedded audio track.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-set-volume.jpg" style="max-width: 700px">


    [anchor:is_playing]

    <h3>is playing</h3>

    <p>Checks if a sound or video is being played back.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-is-playing.jpg" style="max-width: 595px">


    [anchor:mute]

    <h3>mute</h3>

    <p>Mute a sound or video.</p>

    <p>Apart from controlling audio volume, you can use this puzzle to start video playback automatically. This is possible, because web browsers allow playing muted videos without user interaction.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-mute.jpg" style="max-width: 557px">


    [anchor:unmute]

    <h3>unmute</h3>

    <p>Unmute a sound or video.</p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-sound-unmute.jpg" style="max-width: 511px">
