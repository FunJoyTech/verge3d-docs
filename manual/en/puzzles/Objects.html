    <h2>Puzzles Reference</h2>

    [anchor:show]

    <h3>show</h3>

    <p>
    Makes a specified object, that was initially or previously hidden, visible. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, or an object is already visible, does nothing.
    </p>

    [anchor:hide]

    <h3>hide</h3>

    <p>
    Makes a specified object invisible. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, or an object is already invisible, does nothing.
    </p>

    [anchor:is_visible]

    <h3>is visible</h3>

    <p>
    Checks if an object (or any of objects in a list) is currently visible. If it so, returns the logical value *true*, otherwise returns *false*. If there is no such object(s) present in the scene, returns *false*.
    </p>

    [anchor:clone]

    <h3>clone</h3>

    <p>
    Makes an object copy, generates a unique name for the new object and immediately adds it to the scene. Outputs the new object. Does not work with lists, groups or the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle.
    </p>

    [anchor:create_object]

    <h3>create object</h3>

    <p>
      Creates and adds a new object to the scene. This puzzles creates objects without the need in a 3D editor, and as such is useful for learning Puzzles as well as designing primitive visuals by users with no or minimal 3D modelling skills.

    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-create-object.jpg">

    <p>
      For geometry objects, such as boxes or teapots, this puzzles also creates white-colored dielectric glTF-compliant PBR material (with *roughness* value set to *1* and *metalness* set to *0*). Use <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Materials.html#materials_set_color">set color</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Materials.html#materials_set_value">set value</a> puzzles to tweak that material.
    </p>


    [anchor:remove]

    <h3>remove object</h3>

    [anchor:set_transform]

    <h3>set transform</h3>

    <p>
    Moves, rotates or scales an object according to specified transform data. The "offset" checkbox enables moving/rotating/scaling an object relatively to the original position/rotation/scale. Any of the axis inputs can be left blank. Also works for a list of objects, a group (or a list of groups) or with the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Selectors.html#all_objects">all objects</a> puzzle. Sometimes you need to input a vector (which consists of the given X, Y, Z coordinates). In this case, you can modify the puzzle by clicking on the gear icon and setting on checkbox *use vector*.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-set-transform.jpg">



    [anchor:get_transform]

    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-object-add-annotation.jpg">
