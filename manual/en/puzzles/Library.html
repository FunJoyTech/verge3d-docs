    <h1>Library for Your Puzzles</h1>

    <p>Library is a persistent storage for groups of puzzles for re-use in multiple projects.</p>

    [contents]


    [anchor:introduction]

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>There are two libraries in Verge3D:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>*System Library* - stored in *library.xml* file inside the *puzzles* folder. This is the read-only stock library which comes with Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*User Library* - stored in *my_library.xml* file inside the *puzzles* folder. You can use this library to add your own Puzzles.</li>
    </ul>


    [anchor:adding_entries]

    <h2>Adding Entries</h2>

    <p>
    You can add a puzzle group to the <em>user library</em> by right-clicking on it and selecting the option <strong>Save N Puzzles to Library</strong>. In the modal window type the name for the group as it will appear in the library's list of entries. Refresh the list of entries by reloading the page with the Puzzles editor to update that list.
    </p>

    [anchor:using_entries]

    <h2>Using Entries</h2>

    <p>A saved group of puzzle can be retrieved from the library by dragging it out to a workspace.</p>

    [anchor:renaming_entries]

    <h2>Renaming Entries</h2>

    <p>
    There is no dedicated control for renaming library entries as of version 3.1. However, you can easily rename an entry by editing the *my_library.xml* file (in 2 places).
    </p>

    <p>Once renamed, your library entry name will be updated after refreshing the editor.</p>


    [anchor:deleting_entries]

    <h2>Deleting Entries</h2>

    <p>An entry can be deleted from the <em>user library</em> by clicking the ‚ùå button.</p>


    [anchor:backup]

    <h2>Backup</h2>

    <p>
    Every time you save or delete entries, the previously saved file *puzzles/my_library.xml* is copied to the folder called *library_backup* with a timestamp added to the file name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-library-backup.jpg" style="max-width: 971px">

    <p>
    This allows you to restore any of the previously saved revisions of your <em>user library</em> when you need it. Simply copy a file back to the *puzzles* folder root and remove the time stamp from its name. Your library will be updated after refreshing the editor.
