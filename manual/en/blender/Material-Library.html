    <h1>Using Material Library / Blender</h1>

    <p>
    Verge3D material library is a collection of ready-to-use materials which you can assign to your models. Below is the description of a recommended workflow on how to use these materials efficiently.
    </p>

    [contents]



    [anchor:Installing]

    <h2>Installing</h2>

    <p>
    Material library is available in Soft8Soft store in the form of themed packs, for example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-blender-essential-material-pack/" target="_blank">Essential Material Pack</a> (Eevee-based).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/product/verge3d-for-blender-jewelry-material-pack/" target="_blank">Jewelry Material Pack</a> (Eevee-based).
      </li>
      <li>
        Automotive Material Pack (Eevee-based, in development).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Simply unzip the archive with a library pack to any folder on your computer. Inside this folder there are *blend* files (one file per material). The textures used in the materials are located in the *material_maps* folder. The folder *environments* contains 3 variants of HDR images that you can use for the environment (each variant comes in 3 resolutions: 1k, 2k and 4k).
    </p>


    [anchor:Adding_Materials_to_Project]

    <h2>Adding Materials to Project</h2>

    <p>
    In order to use a library material in a project, invoke the *File / Append* dialog.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/append-material.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 835px">

    <p>
    Then navigate to the library folder and click once on the *blend* file with the material you want to add.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/append-material2.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 835px">

    <p>
    Click once on the *Material* folder...
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/append-material3.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 835px">

    <p>
    ...select the material and click the *Append from Library* button.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/append-material4.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p>
    Once a material is appended, you should be able to assign it to a model. Select a model, go to the *Material* tab, click on the small button near the material name (or near the *New* button is there is no material assigned) and select the appended material from the list.
    </p>

    [anchor:Setting_up_the_Environment]

    <h2>Setting up the Environment</h2>

    <p>
    Eevee-based materials require the environment to be set up, otherwise the materials will look dark and non-reflective. The environment is already set up in Verge3D's default cube project which you can use as a basis for your own app. Alternatively, you can configure the environment from scratch as shown in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=symQy5gEHdY" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>. You can use either of HDR textures in the *environments* folder of a material pack for this purpose.
    </p>



    [anchor:UV_Mapping]

    <h2>UV Mapping</h2>

    <p>
    Most materials in the library require models to be UV-mapped. Consider unwrapping your models for best results.
    </p>



    [anchor:Configure_Your_Materials]

    <h2>Configure Your Materials</h2>

    <p>
    Most of the shaders offer sets of inputs by tweaking which you can create a unique material suitable for your needs.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/material-settings.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p>
    Besides that, there are special inputs for easy connection of baked normal and AO maps.
    </p>



    [anchor:Image_Resolution]

    <h2>Image Resolution</h2>

    <p>
    Some materials may use high-res textures (up to 8k) which may affect the loading speed and performance. Consider re-scaling the images if your application does not require such level of detail.
    </p>



    [anchor:Relocating_Textures_to_App_Folder]

    <h2>Relocating Textures to App Folder</h2>

    <p>
    For the sake of integrity of your application (which is important if you're transferring your project sources to a third party), you can save the textures used by appended materials in the app folder as described below.
    </p>

    <p>
    Open the *Image Editor* (or *UV Editor*) in Blender. Select a texture from the drop-down menu, and check its file path.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/texture-file-paths.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 909px">

    <p>
    If it appears that the texture is referenced from the material library folder, use the menu *Image / Save As* to re-save it to your application folder.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/texture-file-paths2.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 909px">

    <p>
    Search for other material library textures and repeat this operation until all textures are relocated.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can check the integrity of your application by moving its folder to another location in your file system. Open the *blend* file and invoke *File / External Data / Report Missing Files*.
    </p>

    <img src="files/mat-library-blender/texture-file-paths3.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 835px">

    <p>
    If any of the textures used in the *blend* file are missing, a yellow splash warning will be shown at the bottom.
    </p>
