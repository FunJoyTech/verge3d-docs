    <h1>Lighting and Rendering / Blender</h1>

    <p>
      This page contains the information about lighting, rendering and background properties which can be used with Verge3D for Blender.
    </p>

    [anchor:renderers]

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D is designed to represent Blender's EEVEE renderer as closely as possible. It supports physically-based shading, lights, shadows and image-based lighting (IBL).
    </p>


    [anchor:environment_lighting]

    <h2>Environment Lighting</h2>

    <p>
      Environment lighting is a very important component of Verge3D graphics pipeline. You can illuminate your entire scene with just an environment map alone, without using any light objects. See the <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/gallery/scooter-3d-product-customizer/" target="_blank">Scooter demo</a> as an example of this approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default cube template provides an HDR texture for image-based lighting. You can replace this texture with your own file, or setup environment lighting from scratch. Here is the basic <em>World nodes</em> setup which uses the same texture for both environment lighting and background:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/world-nodes.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 852px">

    <p class="note">
      When using HDR textures, make sure you set the *Color Space* setting to *Linear*.
    </p>

    [anchor:lights]

    <h2>Lights</h2>

    <p>
      In some cases, using just image-based lighting to illuminate your scene is not enough. If you'd like to simulate some additional light source, need dynamic shadows, or if you need to move your lights (as with car lights), you may use direct light sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following light types:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>*Point Lights* — *Color* and *Power* properties are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Sun Lights* — *Color* and *Strength* properties are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Spot Lights* — *Color*, *Power*, *Spot Shape*: *Size* and *Blend* properties are supported in Verge3D.</li>
      <li>*Area Lights* — *Color*, *Power*, as well *Size* for *Square*-shaped and *Size X*/*Size Y* for *Rectangular*-shaped lights are supported in Verge3D. *Disk* and *Ellipse* shapes are not supported.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition, you can assign Shadow properties on your point, sun, or spot lights. See the <a href="manual/en/blender/Shadows.html">corresponding section</a> for more info.
    </p>


    [anchor:light_probes]

    <h2>Light Probes</h2>

    <p>
      Light Probes are objects intended for adding indirect lighting locally by
      generating a local reflection cubemap. Verge3D currently supports only
      *Reflection Cubemap* light probes. This type of light probe objects add
      specular indirect ligthing to a scene.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following properties are supported:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/light-probe-reflection-cubemap.png" class="centered" style="max-width: 369px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Probe</dt>
      <dd>
        general probe settings:

        <dl>
          <dt>Type</dt>
          <dd>
            type of the influence volume: *Sphere* or *Box*. Only objects
            located inside this volume are affected by the probe's lighting.
          </dd>

          <dt>Radius/Size</dt>
          <dd>
            controls the size of the influence volume. You can also change
            object scaling and make the shape of the influence volume
            non-uniform.
          </dd>

          <dt>Intensity</dt>
          <dd>
            the intensity of the indirect lighting. Any value different from 1.0
            is not physically correct.
          </dd>

          <dt>Clipping Start</dt>
          <dd>
            near clip distance. Objects located closer than this value won't be
            rendered into the reflection cubemap.
          </dd>

          <dt>Clipping End</dt>
          <dd>
            far clip distance. Objects located further than this value won't be
            rendered into the reflection cubemap.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Visibility</dt>
      <dd>
        object visibility settings:

        <dl>
          <dt>Visibility Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            limit objects that should appear on the reflection cubemap to this
            collection. If not specified all scene objects are used.
          </dd>

          <dt>Invert Visibility Collection</dt>
          <dd>
            invert the selection of objects visible to this probe if
            *Visibility Collection* is specified.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>

      <dt>Custom Parallax</dt>
      <dd>
        enable custom settings for the parallax correction. This group of settings
        defines a parallax volume, which is used to project the lighting
        captured by the probe. If *Custom Parallax* not enabled the parallax
        effect is calculated based on *Type* and *Radius/Size* of the influence
        volume.

        <dl>
          <dt>Type</dt>
          <dd>
            type of the parallax volume: *Sphere* or *Box*.
          </dd>

          <dt>Radius/Size</dt>
          <dd>
            the size of the parallax volume.
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      In order to see in Blender's viewport the results of using
      *Reflection Cubemap* objects you need to bake their cubemaps first via the
      *Bake Cubemap Only* or *Bake Indirect Lighting* buttons both located in
      the *Indirect Lighting* panel, which is in the *Render Properties* tab.<br/><br/>

      Also the <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#cubemap_size">Cubemap Size</a>
      property controls the size of the cubemap texture used by *Reflection Cubemap*
      objects.<br/><br/>

      The <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#ibl_environment_mode">IBL Environment Mode</a>
      setting also affects cubemaps generated by *Reflection Cubemap* objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to implementation specifics there are differences of how
      *Reflection Cubemap* light probes behave in Blender and in Verge3D:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Blender supports multiple light probes per object while Verge3D only
          a single one. That's why objects in Verge3D use a single cubemap
          either from a *Reflection Cubemap* object or from the world environment.
          *Falloff* is not supported.
        </li>

        <li>
          Blender doesn't use Backface Culling for meshes by default while
          Verge3D does. Hence in Blender objects placed inside the probe's
          influence volume can appear on the reflection cubemap as black spots
          due to back faces being rendered if the *Clipping Start*/*Clipping End*
          settings are not properly adjusted. This doesn't happen in Verge3D by
          default.
        </li>

        <li>
          When rendering objects into a light probe's cubemap (baking) Blender
          considers only the diffuse component of an object's material, while
          Verge3D renders them no different from how they are rendered on the
          main scene. That's why for example fully metallic objects are rendered
          black in Blender, but in Verge3D they still reflect the world
          environment.
        </li>

        <li>
          For the *Visibility Collection* property to work in Blender it's
          required that the specified collection is also linked to the scene.
          It's not needed in Verge3D and it's enough to just assign an object
          to a collection.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    [anchor:background]

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      By default Blender and Verge3D render the same image for background and environment lighting. To render them separate, use the advanced World nodes setup based on *Is Camera Ray* output of the <a href="manual/en/blender/Shader-Nodes-Reference.html#Light_Path">Light Path</a> node. For example, to set the background color to solid grey and continue using the HDR map for environment lighting:

      <dt>*Outlining Effect*</dt>
      <dd>see <a href="manual/en/blender/Lighting-and-Rendering.html#outline_rendering">below</a>.</dd>

    </dl>


    [anchor:outline_rendering]

    <h2>Outline Rendering</h2>

    <p>
      Outline rendering (aka silhouette edge rendering) is a common non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) technique that can significantly enhance the visual perception of your scene. This effect can be used for various applications such as e-learning, games, architecture visualization, and technical drawing.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use object outlining (and optional glowing) in your Verge3D application, first enable the effect on the Blender's *Render Properties* panel, then use the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#outline">outline</a> puzzle to apply it to your object(s).
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      The outline rendering does not work inside AR/VR sessions. Use other methods to highlight your objects, such as animation or changing material's color.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/outline-example.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 819px">

    <p>You can tweak outlining using the following properties:</p>

    <p>*Enabled* — enable/disable the effect.</p>

    <p>*Edge Strength* — outlining strength factor.</p>

    <p>*Edge Glow* — intensity of additional glowing (rendered beyond the main outline edge).</p>

    <p>*Edge Thickness* — outline edge thickness factor.</p>

    <p>*Pulse Period* — pulse period in seconds. Specify to make the effect animated.</p>

    <p>*Visible Edge Color* — visible edge color.</p>

    <p>*Hidden Edge Color* — color of the outline edge being rendered behind any other scene objects.</p>

    <p>*Render Hidden Edge* — enable/disable rendering of the outline edge behind other scene objects.</p>

    <p class="note">Though it's possible to render glowing objects, in the most cases the outline rendering is used to improve visual clarity of your scene. If you need glowing from lamps or another bright objects, consider using the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Postprocessing.html#bloom">bloom post-processing</a> instead.</p>


    [anchor:per_object_rendering_properties]

    <h2>Per-Object Rendering Properties</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports the following additional rendering properties for your geometry objects:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/rendering-properties.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 313px">

    <p>
      *Rendering Order* — modifies the rendering order for a particular object. The smaller the index, the earlier the object will be rendered. In most cases, you need to tweak this value when using Blend transparency to eliminate transparency artifacts.
    </p>

    <p>
      *Frustum Culling* — enables/disables frustum culling optimization for the object. Uncheck this option if you have some skinned object which can move beyond the screen space to prevent it from being culled.
    </p>

    <p>
      *Receive Shadows* — render or not shadows on the given object. See <a href="manual/en/blender/Shadows.html">here</a> for more info.
    </p>


    [anchor:clipping_planes]

    <h2>Clipping Planes</h2>

    <p>
      Clipping planes (aka section planes, cross-section planes, mesh sections) is a technique used to show internal arrangement of complex objects, such as buildings, cars, appliances, gadgets, machines etc.
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/clipping-plane-example.jpg" class="centered">

    <p>
      To add a new clipping plane, use the *Clipping Plane* menu item from the Blender's *Add Object* menu:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/clipping-plane-new.jpg" class="centered">

    <p>
      The objects on your scene will be clipped in the negative *Z* direction of the clipping plane object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clipping planes have the following properties:
    </p>

    <img src="files/lighting-blender/clipping-plane-properties.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 382px">

    <dl>
      <dt>Affected Objects</dt>
      <dd>
        Collection of the objects clipped by the plane. If empty, all scene objects will be clipped.
      </dd>
      <dt>Negated</dt>
      <dd>
        Swap clipped and unclipped sides.
      </dd>
      <dt>Clip Shadows</dt>
      <dd>
        Clip shadows cast from the clipped objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Union Planes</dt>
      <dd>
        Construct a union from all the clipping planes, affecting the object, not their intersection.
      </dd>
      <dt>Filled Cross-Section</dt>
      <dd>
        Fill cross-section between the clipping plane and the affected objects.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section Color</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section diffuse color and opacity.
      </dd>
      <dt>Cross-Section Plane Size</dt>
      <dd>
        Cross-section plane size. Increase this value if you use larger scene size.
      </dd>
    </dl>
