    <h1>Animation / Blender</h1>

    <p>
    This page contains the information about Blender's animation types which can be used with Verge3D, as well as supported playback options and means to control the animation interactively.
    </p>

    [anchor:Setting_Up_Blender]

    <h2>Setting Up in Blender</h2>


    [anchor:Whole_Object_Animation]

    <h3>Whole-Object Animation</h3>

    <p>
    Animation keyframes can be added in standard ways in Blender, by using Object > Animation > Insert Keyframe... menu (or with the shortcut *I*), selecting another frame on the timeline, moving/rotating/scaling an object to a new position and adding a new animation keyframe for this position.
    </p>

    [anchor:Skeletal_Animation]

    <h3>Skeletal Animation</h3>

    <p>
    An object can be skinned in Blender with an <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/index.html" target="_blank">Armature</a> object. Verge3D support maximum 4 weights per bone (4 most influential weights are selected, others are ignored). The armature's bones can be animated in *Pose Mode* (Ctrl-Tab), by using Pose > Animation > Insert Keyframe... menu (or with the shortcut *I*), selecting another frame on the timeline, moving/rotating/scaling a bone to a new position and adding a new animation keyframe for this position.
    </p>

    [anchor:Shape_Key_Animation]

    <h3>Shape Key Animation</h3>

    <p>
    You can add <a href="manual/en/blender/Morphing.html">shape keys</a> to an object in standard ways in Blender (click on the link for more details).
    </p>

    <img src="files/animation-blender/shape-key-animation.jpg" alt="Shape key animation in Verge3D for Blender" style="max-width: 889px">

    <p>
    The values for shape keys can be animated in Blender, by right-clicking on a value field and selecting *Insert Keyframe* (or by hovering the cursor over it and using the shortcut *I*), selecting another frame on the timeline, setting a new value in the field and adding a new animation keyframe for this value.
    </p>

    [anchor:Material_Animation]

    <h3>Material Animation</h3>

    <p>
    Unlike with Blender, you can only animate a material parameter by first connecting it to a *Value* or *RGB* node.
    </p>

    <img src="files/animation-blender/node-material-animation.jpg" alt="Node material animation in Verge3D for Blender">

    <p>
    The values or colors specified by these nodes can be animated in Blender, by right-clicking on a node and selecting *Insert Keyframe* (or by hovering the cursor over it and using the shortcut *I*), selecting another frame on the timeline, setting a new value or color and adding a new animation keyframe for it.
    </p>

    [anchor:Path_Animation]

    <h3>Path Animation</h3>

    <p>
    To achieve the animation of the movement of an object along a curve, you should assign <a href="manual/en/blender/Object-Constraints.html#Follow_Path">Follow Path constraint</a> to the object. After this, select the path object (the curve) and open the "Object Data Properties" options panel, where you can use the *Path Animation* panel. You have to set animation keyframes on *Evaluation Time* parameter.
    </p>

    <img src="files/animation-blender/curve-path-animation.jpg" alt="Options to animate object along the path">

    <p class="note">Currently only the *Z-Up* twist method is supported.</p>


    [anchor:Procedural_Animation]

    <h3>Procedural Animation</h3>

    <p>
    Instead of playing back some animation which was pre-made in Blender, you can use Puzzles or JavaScript to modify coordinates or some other parameters with time. Particulurly, the <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html#animate_param">animate param</a> puzzle (based on the Tween.js library) is a convenient way to create your own animation on the fly.
    </p>

    [anchor:Playback_Options]

    <h2>Playback Options</h2>


    [anchor:Verge3D_Per_Object_Settings]

    <h3>Verge3D Per-Object Settings</h3>

    <p>
    Each object in Blender is assigned with Verge3D settings, including the settings for animation playback.
    </p>

    <img src="files/animation-blender/blender-verge3d-animation-settings.jpg" alt="Verge3D for Blender animation settings panel" style="max-width: 403px">

    <p>
    Animation settings:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    *Auto Start* - whether this object's animation will start after the scene is loaded.
    </li>
    <li>
    *Loop Mode* - playback mode: *Repeat* - plays from the start to the end and repeats, *Once* - plays one time and stops, *Ping Pong* - plays from the start to the end and then in reverse.
    </li>
    <li>
    *Repeat Infinitely* - whether this object's animation will be played all over again. Valid only for *Repeat* and *Ping Pong* modes.
    </li>
    <li>
    *Repeat Count* - how many times the animation will be played. Valid only for *Repeat* and *Ping Pong* modes if *Repeat Infinitely* is disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
    *Offset* - how many frames will be skipped before the animation starts.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    [anchor:Interpolation]

    <h3>Interpolation</h3>

    <p>
    The menu for switching keyframe interpolation is invoked with right click on the timeline window in Blender (shortcut *T*).
    </p>

    <img src="files/animation-blender/interpolation.jpg" alt="Keyframe interpolation in Verge3D for Blender">

    <p>
    All interpolation modes available in Blender for animation keyframes are supported by Verge3D.
    </p>


    [anchor:Frame_Rate]

    <h3>Frame Rate</h3>

    <p>
    The frame rate value (default - 24 fps) which affect the playback speed can be changed in the *Output Properties* tab.
    </p>

    [anchor:Animation_Control_with_Puzzles]

    <h2>Animation Control with Puzzles</h2>

    <p>
    You can use <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Animation.html">animation puzzles</a> for playing back a pre-made animation (click on the link for more details).
    </p>

    <img src="files/puzzles/puzzles-animation.jpg" alt="Animation puzzles of Verge3D">

    <p>
    Animation can also be implemented with other visual scripting blocks - see <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Camera.html">Camera</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Time.html">Time</a> puzzles.
