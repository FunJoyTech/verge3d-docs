    <h1>App Manager</h1>

    <p>App Manager is an easy-to-use tool for creating and performing various operations with Verge3D applications.</p>

    [anchor:Running_App_Manager]

    <h2>Running App Manager</h2>

    <p>
    The App Manager is implemented as web pages shown by the locally-run web server, similar to WiFi router admin panel.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-main.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p>
    By default, the pages are served from the address <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a>, which you can navigate to, refresh or bookmark. The server can be launched in several ways (see below).
    </p>



    [anchor:From_Blender_Max_Maya]

    <h3>A. From Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya</h3>

    <p>The local web server is started automatically when you launch your 3D tool with Verge3D plug-in installed. Upon clicking on the App Manager button (Blender) or menu option (Max, Maya), the App Manager page is shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-blender.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 951px">
    <img src="files/beginner_guide/app-manager-max.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 951px">

    <p>
    If the web server happens to be down for some reason (e.g. you closed the first launched instance of your 3D editor), this operator also restarts it.
    </p>



    [anchor:Using_Desktop_Application]

    <h3>B. Using Desktop Application</h3>

    <p>The local web server can be launched even without running Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya. Simply click on the desktop icon created by the Verge3D installer (Windows-only). The App Manager page will be immediately shown in the web browser.</p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-desktop-icon.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 1000px">

    <p>
    If the web server is already running (e.g. you launched it from the 3D editor), this desktop application just opens the App Manager in the browser.
    </p>



    [anchor:From_Command_Line]

    <h3>C. From Command-Line</h3>

    <p>
    Install Python 3, e.g. from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>. Once you have Python 3 installed, launch *Command Prompt* and type:
    </p>

    <code>
    cd verge3d_blender
    </code>

    <p>
    (or whatever path you installed Verge3D in), and then for Blender version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py BLENDER
    </code>

    <p>
    for Max version type:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAX
    </code>

    <p>
    or for Maya:
    </p>

    <code>
    python manager\server.py MAYA
    </code>

    <p>
    Finally, open up the browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8668/" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a> as usual. Users of maxOS or Linux can use the same commands, only with forward slashes.
    </p>



    [anchor:Exploring_Applications]

    <h2>Exploring Applications</h2>



    [anchor:List_Main_Page]

    <h3>List on the Main Page</h3>

    <p>
    Upon starting or refreshing the main page, the App Manager scans the folder *applications* in the installation directory, and displays all found folders as a list. If *External applications directory* is specified in App Manager settings, the folders from inside that directory are also appended to the bottom of the list.
    </p>

    <p>
    For each application in the list, the App Manager displays all .html, .gltf/.glb and 3D editor save files (.blend, .max, .ma/.mb) found in an application folder. These files can be viewed by clicking on their icons.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Application lines which contain too many files are expandable through the triangle icon near app name.
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-list-files-expand.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 800px">

    <p>
    Applications can be filtered using the search field on the top.
    </p>

    </p>



    [anchor:Templates]

    <h2>Templates</h2>
   
   

    [anchor:Whats_a_Template]

    <h3>What's a Template</h3>
       
    <p>
    When creating a new application, you may select a template from which the app will be created. By default, 3 templates are offered: "Standard Light", "Standard Dark", and "Code-Based".
    </p>
    
    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-explanation.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
    The source files for these templates can be found in the templates folder, e.g. "verge3d_blender\manager\templates". You can modify these files or create an entirely new template for use in your project.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
    In the templates folder, there is also a hidden template called "Embeddable" which you can use for creating React.js or Vue.js applications.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There are many possible ways to modify/improve your template. You can change the layout by editing HTML/CSS files, embed/use some JavaScript code or library, replace the UI elements or the preloader, or add some puzzles to be included in each new application by default. 
    </p>



    [anchor:Creating_Templates]

    <h3>Creating Templates</h3>

    <p>
    In order to create your own template, click the button *Manage App Templates* on the left bar:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 751px">

    <p>
    In the panel shown up, click <strong>+Template</strong> and specify the name for your new template (e.g. "My Template"), then click *Apply*:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-manage.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 656px">

    <p>
    As a result, every time you create a new application, the option to choose your template will appear: 
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-templates-choose-created.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 522px">

    <p>
    By default, an empty folder will be created for your application, since no files were provided for the new template. The easiest way to start with a real template is to copy some of the existing templates (e.g. "Standard Dark") and rename the copied folder according to the name of your template (that is, "My Template"). 
    </p>



    [anchor:App_Manager_Settings]

    <h2>App Manager Settings</h2>


  
    <p>
    By clicking the gear button on the left bar, you can open up the panel with various settings:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-settings.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 751px">

    <p>
    It looks as follows by default:
    </p>

    <img src="files/app-manager/app-manager-settings-panel.jpg" class="centered" style="max-width: 612px">
   
    <dl>

      <dt>Notify about Verge3D updates</dt>

      <dd>the App Manager will display a notification in case a new stable Verge3D version is available (enabled by default).</dd>


      <dt>Upload app sources (models, puzzles, backups)</dt>

      <dd>the <a href="manual/en/introduction/App-Manager.html#Publish">Publish</a> feature will upload the files that are normally not needed for running an application online, and as such are skipped by default. This includes .blend, .max, .ma/.mb, visual_logic.xml, and the contents of the v3d_app_data folder. You can enable this when you want to share the source files with your collegues.</dd>


      <dt>Enable external server interface</dt>

      <dd>use the IP address in your local Wi-Fi or Ethernet network instead of <a href="http://localhost:8668" target="_blank">localhost:8668</a>. You can find your computer IP address from the operating system preferences: <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/find-windows-10-device-ip-address/" target="_blank">Win 10</a>, <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/microsoft/windows-7/find-your-local-ip-address-windows-7-cmd/" target="_blank">Win 7</a>, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-IP-Address-on-a-Mac" target="_blank">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/determine-public-ip-address-command-line-curl/" target="_blank">Linux</a>. Launch the App Manager by navigating to the network address, e.g.: <a href="http://192.168.1.15:8668" target="_blank">192.168.1.15:8668</a></dd>


      <dt>Verge3D Network cache age (minutes)</dt>

      <dd>set the period of time after which Verge3D Network will refresh the re-uploaded application. Set this to 0 (that is, refresh instantly) for faster iterations in developement.</dd>


      <dt>External applications directory</dt>

      <dd>use the specified absolute path (e.g. C:\Users\Alex\my_verge) for applications folder alongside the standard one (such as verge3d_blender\applications). The folders from the specified directory will be displayed in App Manager's list of applications.</dd>


      <dt>Current theme</dt>

      <dd>switch the App Manager and Puzzles editor between Light and Dark modes.</dd>
