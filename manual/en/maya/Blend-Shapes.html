    <h1>Blend Shapes (aka Morphing) / Maya</h1>

    <p>
      Blend Shapes (called Morphing in Verge3D) is a feature which allows you to modify mesh objects in real-time. The most common use case for this feature is facial animation. Morphing also suits well to creating parametric objects which can interactively change their dimensions, shape, thickness, holes, profiles etc.

    <p>See the following demo as an example:</p>

    <h2>Setting Up</h2>

    <p>
        In Maya, open the <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-CharacterAnimation/files/GUID-3C92402C-B24E-4874-AC8D-EADF976A19DC-htm.html" target="_blank">Shape Editor</a>,
        and setup targets for your objects. Please notice that due to hardware
        constraints, you can create only one blend shape with a limited amount
        of active targets. Most of the time it's 5 targets for skinned objects
        and 6 for others. See <a href="manual/en/introduction/Hardware-Related-Issues.html#too_many_attributes">this topic</a>
        for more information about calculating the limit in more complex cases.<br/><br/>

        During rendering, the engine selects 6 shape targets with largest
        influences ignoring all excessive targets.

    [anchor:animating]

    <h2>Animating Blend Shapes</h2>

    <p>
      Verge3D supports keyframe animation of blend shape weights. Check out the <a href="manual/en/maya/Animation.html#Blend_Shape_Animation">Animation</a> section for more details.
    </p>


    [anchor:controlling_with_puzzles]

    <h2>Controlling via Puzzles</h2>

    <p>
      To manipulate your morph targets in real-time there are two puzzles: <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#get_morph_factor">get morph factor</a> and <a href="manual/en/puzzles/Objects.html#set_morph_factor">set morph factor</a>.
