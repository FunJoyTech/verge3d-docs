        <div class="desc">
            A class for setting up a 3D application, capable of loading the Puzzles 
            editor and executing visual logic code.<br /><br />
            
            Performs app initialization/loading in the following order:
            <ul>
                <li>starts loading a scene, a logic script and the Puzzles Editor depending 
                    on the method used ([page:.loadScene], [page:.loadSceneWithLogic], 
                    [page:.loadSceneWithEditor])
                </li>
                <li>calls the corresponding callback ([page:.onSceneLoad], 
                    [page:.onLogicLoad], [page:.onEditorLoad]) 
                    when something is loaded or the [page:.onError] callback in 
                    case of an error
                </li>
                <li>calls the [page:.onLoadFinished] callback after all loading 
                    actions were finished successfully or not
                </li>
                <li>removes the preloader, starts the rendering cycle and 
                    executes the logic script successively by calling the 
                    [page:.run] method.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <h2>Constructor</h2>

        <h3>[name](containerId, ctxSettings, preloader)</h3>
        <div>
            [page:String containerId] - the id of an HTML-element containing the canvas.<br />
            [page:Object ctxSettings] - the WebGL context attributes to be passed in the 'canvas.getContext()' method.<br />
            [page:Preloader preloader] - the application's Preloader.<br />
        </div>


        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:App] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:Object ExternalInterface]</h3>
        <div>
            An object containing functions created in the Puzzles Editor to 
            access them from the application's code. Typical usage: calling a 
            function manually, setting/overriding a function.
        </div>


        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:App] class for common methods.</div>

        <h3>[method:null loadScene](url)</h3>
        <div>Load a gltf scene specified by the url parameter.</div>
        
        <h3>[method:null loadSceneWithEditor](url, logicURL, editorDir)</h3>
        <div>
            Load a gltf scene along with the Puzzles Editor. The editor needs 
            to be provided with the path to the target logic JS file (specified 
            by the logicURL parameter) and with the path to the Puzzles 
            Editor's resource folder (specified by the editorDir parameter, 
            should have the content of the SDK's 'puzzles' folder).
        </div>
        
        <h3>[method:null loadSceneWithLogic](url, logicURL)</h3>
        <div>
            Load a gltf scene along with the code generated from the Puzzles 
            Editor (specified by the logicURL parameter).
        </div>

        <h3>[method:null onEditorLoad]()</h3>
        <div>
            A callback, called when the Puzzles Editor was successfully loaded.
        </div>
        
        <h3>[method:null onError](error)</h3>
        <div>
            A callback, called when an error is occured during the loading process. 
            Some specific errors with the following names are also generated:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    EditorLoadError - the Puzzles Editor wasn't properly loaded
                </li>
                <li>
                    LogicLoadError - the logic file wasn't properly loaded
                </li>
                <li>
                    SceneLoadError - the scene file wasn't properly loaded
                </li>
            </ul>
            Prints all errors in the browser console by default.
        </div>

        <h3>[method:null onLoadFinished](sceneLoaded, logicLoaded, editorLoaded)</h3>
        <div>
            A callback, called when all loading actions are finsihed successfully 
            or not, which is indicated by its parameters: sceneLoaded, 
            logicLoaded and editorLoaded.
            By default calls the [page:.run] method if a scene was loaded.
        </div>
        
        <h3>[method:null onLogicLoad]()</h3>
        <div>
            A callback, called when the logic file was successfully loaded.
        </div>

        <h3>[method:null onSceneLoad]()</h3>
        <div>
            A callback, called when the scene file was successfully loaded.
        </div>

        <h3>[method:null run]()</h3>
        <div>
            Starts the application by removing the preloader, starting the 
            rendering cycle and executing the logic script.
        </div>
