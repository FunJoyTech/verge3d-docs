        <h1>[name]</h1>

        <div class="desc">
            A constraint which restricts the position of the constrained object 
            based on the target's position. Thus the target object behaves like an
            "inivisible wall", "floor", etc...<br /><br />

            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:String floorLocation]</h3>
        <div>
            The axis to apply the restriction along. Can be one of the "X", "-X", "Y", "-Y", "Z", "-Z". 
            Positive means that the constrained object's position along this axis can only be above  
            the [page:.offset] value. Negative means - only under the [page:.offset] value. Default is "Y".
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean isFloorConstraint]</h3>
        <div>
            Used to check whether this or derived classes are floor constraints. Default is *true*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Number offset]</h3>
        <div>
            The limiting value along the [page:.floorLocation] axis. Default is 0.
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
        <div>
            The constraint's type. Equals to "FloorConstraint".
        </div>
