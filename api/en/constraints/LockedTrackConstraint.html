        <div class="desc">
            A constraint which makes the constrained object track the target and 
            also locks on of the object's axes.<br /><br />

            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.

        <h3>[property:Boolean isLockedTrackConstraint]</h3>
        <div>
            Used to check whether this or derived classes are locked track 
            constraints. Default is *true*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:String lockAxis]</h3>
        <div>
            The axis of the constrained object that is locked. Can be one of 
            the "X", "Y", "Z". Default is "Y".
        </div>

        <h3>[property:String trackAxis]</h3>
        <div>
            The axis of the constrained object that tracks the target. Can be 
            one of the "X", "-X", "Y", "-Y", "Z", "-Z". Default is "X".
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
        <div>
            The constraint's type. Equals to "LockedTrackConstraint".
