        <div class="desc">
            A constraint forces the object, to which it is applied, to have the same transforms as its target.<br /><br />

            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
        </div>

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean fixCameraLightRotation]</h3>
        <div>
            In Verge3D we use right-handed coordinate system with the Y axis pointing in the up direction, but Blender and 3ds Max uses right-handed coordinate system with Z axis pointing in the up direction (<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/wiki/index.php/Coordinate_Systems">Verge3D wiki</a>). So, to correct the rotation for cameras and lights, set *fixCameraLightRotation = true*. Default is *false*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean isCopyTransformsConstraint]</h3>
        <div>
            Used to check whether this or derived classes are copy transforms constraints. Default is *true*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Float influence]</h3>
        <div>
            The percentage of influence the constraint has on the object. Default is *1.0* (100%).
        </div>

        <h3>[property:String mixMode]</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Specifies how the new transforms is combined with the existing transforms. Default is *"REPLACE"*.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>"AFTER"</dt>
              <dd>
                The new transforms is added after the existing transforms.
              </dd>
              <dt>"BEFORE"</dt>
              <dd>
                The new transforms is added before the existing transforms.
              </dd>
              <dt>"REPLACE"</dt>
              <dd>
                The transform values replace existing values.
              </dd>
            </dl>
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
        <div>
            The constraint's type. Equals to "CopyTransformsConstraint".
        </div>
