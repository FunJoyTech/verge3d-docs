            A constraint forces its owner to stay either further from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target.<br /><br />

            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
        <div>
            The distance from target. Default is *0.0*.
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:Float influence]</h3>
        <div>
            The percentage of influence the constraint has on the object. Default is *1.0* (100%).
        </div>

        <h3>[property:String limitMode]</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Specifies the distance clamping mode. Default is *"LIMITDIST_ONSURFACE"*.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt>"LIMITDIST_INSIDE"</dt>
              <dd>
                The owner stays further from a given distance from its target.
              </dd>
              <dt>"LIMITDIST_OUTSIDE"</dt>
              <dd>
                The owner stays nearer to a given distance from its target.
              </dd>
              <dt>"LIMITDIST_ONSURFACE"</dt>
              <dd>
                The owner stays exactly at a given distance from its target.
              </dd>
            </dl>
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean isLimitDistanceConstraint]</h3>
        <div>
            Used to check whether this or derived classes are limit distance constraints. Default is *true*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
        <div>
            The constraint's type. Equals to "LimitDistanceConstraint".
        </div>
