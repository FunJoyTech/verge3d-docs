        <h1>[name]</h1>

        <div class="desc">
            A constraint constrains one local axis of the owner to always point towards Target. This constraint uses a pure Swing rotation, i.e. the shortest possible single axis rotation. In other 3D software you can find it with the name “Look at” constraint.<br /><br />

            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:TargetConstraint] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean fixCameraLightRotation]</h3>
        <div>
            In Verge3D we use right-handed coordinate system with the Y axis pointing in the up direction, but Blender and 3ds Max uses right-handed coordinate system with Z axis pointing in the up direction (<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/wiki/index.php/Coordinate_Systems">Verge3D wiki</a>). So, to correct the rotation for cameras and lights, set *fixCameraLightRotation = true*. Default is *false*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Float influence]</h3>
        <div>
            The percentage of influence the constraint has on the object. Default is *1.0* (100%).
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean isDampedTrackConstraint]</h3>
        <div>
            Used to check whether this or derived classes are damped track constraints. Default is *true*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:String trackAxis]</h3>
        <div>
            The axis to always point towards Target. Can be one of the "X", "Y", "Z", "-X", "-Y", "-Z". Default is "X".
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
        <div>
            The constraint's type. Equals to "DampedTrackConstraint".
        </div>
