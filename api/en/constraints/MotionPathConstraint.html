        <div class="desc">
            A constraint which makes the constrained object move along the curve path.<br /><br />

            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.
        </div>

        <h2>Constructor</h2>

        <h3>[name]()</h3>


        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:Constraint] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean bank]</h3>
        <div>
            Enables banking. Banking means the object will lean in towards the center of the curvature of the curve that it travels along, like a motorcycle going around a corner, i.e. it is a kind of roll to left-right. Default is *false*.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Float bankScale]</h3>
        <div>
            Scales the banking angle. Default is 1.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Float bankLimit]</h3>
        <div>
            The maximum allowed absolute banking angle in radians. Default is Infinity.
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Array chordLengths]</h3>
        <div>
            The [page:Array array] of sums of chord lengths. Chord lengths are stored like this:<br />
            <code>[lengthOfChord1, lengthOfChord1 + lengthOfChord2, ...]</code> The last element equals to approximated curve length. Note: does not work when [page:.useChordLength useChordLength] is disabled. Default is [].
        </div>

        <h3>[property:Number chordsNum]</h3>
        <div>
            The total chords count on the curve, used when [page:MotionPathConstraint.useChordLength useChordLength] flag is enabled. The bigger the number the more uniformly will be object movement. If chordsNum <= 0 then it will be computated automatically. Note: always call [page:.init init] method to apply changes. Default is 0.
