            A constraint which limits the constrained object's position in its 
            parent's space.<br /><br />
            
            Constraints are used to set up various relations between objects by
            affecting their position, rotation and scale. Can be used with the 
            [page:Object3D.constraints Object3D.constraints] property.

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <div>See the base [page:Constraint] class for common properties.</div>

        <h3>[property:Boolean isLimitLocationConstraint]</h3>
        <div>
            Used to check whether this or derived classes are limit location constraints. Default is *true*.
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:Vector3 max]</h3>
        <div>
            A [page:Vector3] holding the maximum values along the corresponding 
            axes to limit the constrained object's position. Default is Vector3(Infinity, Infinity, Infinity).
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:Vector3 min]</h3>
        <div>
            A [page:Vector3] holding the minimum values along the corresponding 
            axes to limit the constrained object's position. Default is Vector3(-Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity).
        </div>
        
        <h3>[property:String type]</h3>
        <div>
            The constraint's type. Equals to "LimitLocationConstraint".
        </div>
