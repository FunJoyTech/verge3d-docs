    <h1>[name]</h1>

    <p class="desc">A class containing useful utility functions for scene manipulation.</p>


    <h2>Methods</h2>


    <h3>[method:Group createMultiMaterialObject]([page:Geometry geometry], [page:Array materials])</h3>
    <p>
    geometry -- The geometry for the set of materials. <br />
    materials -- The materials for the object.
    </p>
    <p>
    Creates a new Group that contains a new mesh for each material defined in materials. Beware that this is not the same as an array of materials which defines multiple materials for 1 mesh.<br />
    This is mostly useful for objects that need both a material and a wireframe implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:null attach]([page:Object3D child], [page:Object3D scene], [page:Object3D parent])</h3>
    <p>
    child -- The object to add to the parent  <br />
    scene -- The scene to detach the object on. <br />
    parent -- The parent to attach the object from.
    </p>
    <p>
    Attaches the object to the parent without the moving the object in the worldspace. Beware that to do this the matrixWorld needs to be updated, this can be done by calling the updateMatrixWorld method on the parent object.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:Boolean checkActionIsUsed]([page:Object3D scene], [page:AnimationAction action])</h3>
    <p>
    scene -- The scene to check if the action is used with one of the scene objects. <br />
    action -- The action to check.
    </p>
    <p>
    Checks if the given action is used with one of the scene objects, i.e. the
    action's target node exists on the scene.
    </p>

    <h3>[method:null getAnimationActionByName]([page:App scope], animClipName)</h3>
    <p>
      scope -- The instance of [page:App application] class.<br />
      animClipName -- The name of the animation clip.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Search for animation action by its clip name.
    </p>


    <h3>[method:null detach]([page:Object3D child], [page:Object3D parent], [page:Object3D scene])</h3>
    <p>
    child -- The object to remove from the parent  <br />
    scene -- The scene to attach the object on. <br />
    parent -- The parent to detach the object from.
    </p>
    <p>
    Detaches the object from the parent and adds it back to the scene without moving in worldspace. Beware that to do this the matrixWorld needs to be updated, this can be done by calling the updateMatrixWorld method on the parent object.
    </p>
